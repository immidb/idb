## ImmiDB 
A fast, private and easy to use web application for Immigration Law practices that integrates USCIS Case Status and EOIR court data. 

After a couple decades in application development and corporate IT, I created ImmiDB in 2014 for my husband's growing but still young Immigration Law practice. We were looking for an inexpensive but fast, easy way to track and bill clients.  Now his practice is considerably larger and ImmiDB has become an almost full-time project for me; which I've evolved and continously added functionality to over the last 5 years, now incorporating EOIR court data and integrating USCIS Forms.  

If you're interested, take a quick look at the demo and [compare to other Immigration Law tools]().  We are not looking for many firms to implement ImmiDB but we are looking for dedicated ones for which ImmiDB can help their practice.
